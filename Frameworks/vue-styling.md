# Styling Elements with Vue

## Inline Styles
In the past, we have advocated against the use of inline styles, since they make CSS harder to debug and make HTML harder to read. However, front-end frameworks actually make inline styling a powerful tool due to their ability to contain CSS to small, reusable pieces of front-end code. We will use them extensively later on in your Vue journey.

Here is the syntax for adding dynamic inline styles using Vue:
```html
<h2 v-bind:style="{ color: breakingNewsColor, 'font-size': breakingNewsFontSize }">Breaking News</h2>
```

```javascript
const app = new Vue({ 
  data: { 
    breakingNewsColor: 'red',
    breakingNewsFontSize: '32px'
  }
});
```

In this example, we use the `v-bind:style` directive to set the value of two inline styles to two Vue app properties. The value of the `v-bind:style` directive is an object where the keys are CSS properties and the values are dynamic properties on the Vue app.

> üí°**Note**: Note in the example that if we want to set a value for a hyphenated CSS property, such as `font-size`, we need to put the property name in quotes in order to construct a valid JavaScript object.

This example only used values stored in data, however computed properties can be used for `v-bind:style` and all of the other directives covered in this lesson in the same way.

## Computed Style Objects

A common pattern for adding dynamic inline style objects is to add a dynamic Vue app property that generates the style object. For example, we could refactor the previous example as follows:

```html
<h2 v-bind:style="breakingNewsStyles">Breaking News</h2>
```

```javascript
const app = new Vue({ 
  data: { 
    breakingNewsStyles: { 
      color: 'red',
      'font-size': '32px'
    }
  }
});
```

In this example, we store the style object, `breakingNewsStyles`, as a Vue app property and then make that object the value of `v-bind:style`. Using this pattern, we can make style objects for specific, reusable use cases.

This pattern also allows us to consolidate similar style-computing logic to a single computed property instead of computing styles on a rule-by-rule basis. Instead of creating a computed property for every rule that we want to apply to an element if it passes a certain condition, we can instead create a single computed property that checks the condition and then returns an object with all of the relevant style rules.

## Multiple Style Objects

Another powerful aspect of v-bind:style is that it can also take an array of style objects as a value.

```javascript
const app = new Vue({ 
  data: {
    newsHeaderStyles: { 
      'font-weight': 'bold', 
      color: 'grey'
    },
    breakingNewsStyles: { 
      color: 'red'
    }
  }
});
```

```html
<h2 v-bind:style="[newsHeaderStyles, breakingNewsStyles]">Breaking News</h2>
```

In this example, we‚Äôve added another Vue app property, `newsHeaderStyles`. This is a style object that will presumably be used to style all news item headers. Then, using an array with `v-bind:style`, we add both of these style objects to our `Breaking News` element.

> üí° You may notice that both of these style objects contain a `color` value. When this happens, the style object added later in the array gets priority. So, `Breaking News` will be `bold` and `red`. The `grey` color rule will be overridden and not used.

## Classes
Let‚Äôs check out how to dynamically add CSS classes instead of inline styles.

```html
<span v-bind:class="{ unread: hasNotifications }">Notifications</span>
```

```css
.unread {
  background-color: blue;
}
```

```javascript
const app = new Vue({
  data: { notifications: [ ... ] },
  computed: {
    hasNotifications: function() {
      return notifications.length > 0;
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, we are using the `v-bind:class` directive to dynamically add a class called `unread` to a ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù `<span>` element if the computed property `hasNotifications` returns `true`.

`v-bind:class` takes an object as its value ‚Äî the keys of this object are class names and the values are Vue app properties that return a truthy or falsy value. If the value is truthy, the class will be added to the element ‚Äî otherwise it will not be added.

In this example, if there are notifications in the notifications array, the `unread` class will be added to the ‚ÄúNotifications‚Äù element causing the element to be styled blue.

> üí° **Note**: Similar to before with `v-bind:style`, you can also set the value of `v-bind:class` to a Vue app property that returns a class object instead of writing the object out in your HTML file.

**For example, let's compare two implementations**: 

1. Directly in HTML:
```html
<button v-bind:class="{ active: someCondition }">Click Me</button>
```
* Explanation: The class object is directly written in the HTML. This is simple for small conditions but can clutter the HTML if the logic is complex.

2. Using a Vue property:
```html
<button v-bind:class="buttonClasses">Click Me</button>
```

In your Vue instance:
```javascript
computed: {
  buttonClasses() {
    return { active: this.someCondition };
  }
}
```

* Explanation: The logic is moved to a computed property. This keeps the HTML clean and allows for more complex logic in JavaScript, making it easier to maintain and read. 

The second approach is better for complex conditions and keeps the HTML cleaner.

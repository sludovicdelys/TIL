# Vue.js 

## Adding Vue
In summary, front-end frameworks aim to fix the following issues in front-end web development :
- Long development times
- Difficult bug fixes and updates
- Slow page rendering

The first thing youâ€™ll need to do to begin using any front-end framework is to add the framework to your project. You can import Vue by adding a `<script>` tag inside the `<head>` of your projectâ€™s HTML file :

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js" defer></script>
```
We use the `defer` attribute on the `<script> tag to make sure that the page is loaded and ready to hook up to Vue before we actually load Vue.

The Vue team recognized that many complex front-end features arenâ€™t useful until late in the front-end learning journey (or sometimes at all). As a result, they offered this simple alternative that provides most of Vueâ€™s features to developers quickly and easily.

## Creating Vue Apps

Vue makes it easy to make a new app by exporting a class called `Vue`. Much like any other JavaScript class, we create instances of this class using the `new` keyword. Each of these `Vue` instances is a fully-functioning Vue app.

```javascript
// app.js
const app = new Vue({              //Creates new Vue app
  el: '#app',                      //Options Object
  data: { username: 'michael' },   //contains all information about the Vue app
  ...
});
```

The `Vue` constructor can set many properties on our `Vue` app when it is called. However, unlike many constructors, the `Vue` class does not take each of these properties as separate arguments.

> ðŸ’¡ Vue apps require a lot of information â€” information that will differ greatly from app to app. To accommodate this, the Vue constructor doesnâ€™t attempt to take in each piece of information as its own parameter. This would require developers to keep careful track of which order arguments were expected in, making it difficult to add properties or make changes.

The Vue constructor takes in only one object, called the **options object**. Each piece of information the Vue app needs to function is added to the options object as a key-value pair. This means that developers can easily update or add information in the Vue app by just looking for the correct key in the options object.

## Components 

### Naming
The Vue.js style guide recommends that component names should always be multi-word, except for root App components, to prevent conflicts with existing and future HTML elements. This is because the HTML Living Standard specifies that custom elements (which Vue components essentially are) must contain a hyphen in their name.

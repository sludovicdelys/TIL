# Vue.js 

## Adding Vue
In summary, front-end frameworks aim to fix the following issues in front-end web development :
- Long development times
- Difficult bug fixes and updates
- Slow page rendering

The first thing you‚Äôll need to do to begin using any front-end framework is to add the framework to your project. You can import Vue by adding a `<script>` tag inside the `<head>` of your project‚Äôs HTML file :

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js" defer></script>
```
We use the `defer` attribute on the `<script> tag to make sure that the page is loaded and ready to hook up to Vue before we actually load Vue.

The Vue team recognized that many complex front-end features aren‚Äôt useful until late in the front-end learning journey (or sometimes at all). As a result, they offered this simple alternative that provides most of Vue‚Äôs features to developers quickly and easily.

## Creating Vue Apps

Vue makes it easy to make a new app by exporting a class called `Vue`. Much like any other JavaScript class, we create instances of this class using the `new` keyword. Each of these `Vue` instances is a fully-functioning Vue app.

```javascript
// app.js
const app = new Vue({              //Creates new Vue app
  el: '#app',                      //Options Object
  data: { username: 'michael' },   //contains all information about the Vue app
  ...
});
```

The `Vue` constructor can set many properties on our `Vue` app when it is called. However, unlike many constructors, the `Vue` class does not take each of these properties as separate arguments.

> üí° Vue apps require a lot of information ‚Äî information that will differ greatly from app to app. To accommodate this, the Vue constructor doesn‚Äôt attempt to take in each piece of information as its own parameter. This would require developers to keep careful track of which order arguments were expected in, making it difficult to add properties or make changes.

The Vue constructor takes in only one object, called the **options object**. Each piece of information the Vue app needs to function is added to the options object as a key-value pair. This means that developers can easily update or add information in the Vue app by just looking for the correct key in the options object.

## Introduction to Vue

### el 
In making a new Vue app, we gain access to all of the powerful features Vue has to offer. However, we don‚Äôt necessarily want all of our HTML to have access to these features. We need to specify to our Vue app which portion of our HTML we want to gain access to our Vue app‚Äôs logic.

We do this by adding a key-value pair to the Vue app‚Äôs options object. We add a key called `el`, standing for HTML __el__ement, with a value of a CSS selector as a string that will target an element in our HTML and give it access to our Vue app‚Äôs functionality.

```javascript
// app.js
const app = new Vue({
  el: '#app'
});
```

In the above example, we wanted an HTML element with an ID of `app` to gain access to our Vue app‚Äôs functionality. We added an `el` key to the options object and made the value `'#app'`, a CSS selector that will target an element with an ID, `#`, of `app`.

We then import this JavaScript file into our HTML file so that our Vue app can find the specified HTML element and turn it into a Vue app.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js" defer></script>
  <script src="./js/app.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="app">
    <!-- Vue App HTML Code -->
  </div>
</body>
```

In this example, we wrote the HTML that will be turned into a Vue app. Then, in the `<head>` we imported the file containing the JavaScript from the previous example that will turn the HTML `#app` `<div>` element into a Vue app.

**Note**: We must import our Vue app code after the `<script>` that loads Vue.js. Otherwise, we would not yet have access to the Vue library in app.js, making it impossible to create a Vue app. This is also why we add `defer` to both elements ‚Äî to ensure Vue has fully loaded when we go to make our Vue app.

### Data

An essential feature of all front-end frameworks is rendering and updating dynamic data. Information like the number of likes on a social media post may change at any second. Front-end frameworks must make it easy to display these types of dynamic data and automatically update them for users as soon as they change.

To display dynamic information we need:
- A place to store the data we will be displaying
- A syntax for displaying that information

Everything our Vue app needs should be provided on the options object when the Vue app is created. Therefore, all of our dynamic data will need to be specified in our options object at a property called `data`.

```javascript
const app = new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  data: {
    username: 'Michael'
  }
});
```

Apps need to display many pieces of dynamic data. To accommodate this, the value of `.data` is an object as well. Every piece of data will be added to the `.data` object as a key-value pair.

> üí° Note: In most apps, your code would likely get this data from a database.

### Templates

Vue makes use of **templating**, meaning that the developer specifies certain content in our HTML that isn‚Äôt meant to be displayed literally but rather substituted out with the appropriate data from the app. We specify which content inside our HTML should be substituted by surrounding it in two layers of curly brackets, like so :

```html
<div id="app">
  <h2>Hello, {{ username }}</h2>
</div>
```

> üí° Note : Using curly brackets for templating in HTML was popularized by a framework called mustache. As a result, curly braces in templates are often called ‚Äúmustaches.‚Äù

### Directives

Directives are custom HTML attributes built into Vue that accomplish incredibly complex, common front-end operations using barely any code.

For example, one very common front-end need is to conditionally display elements. Let‚Äôs say we only want to show a login button if a user isn‚Äôt already logged in. We can add a `v-if` directive as an attribute to HTML elements like so :

```html
<button v-if="userIsLoggedIn">Log Out</button>
<button v-if="!userIsLoggedIn">Log In</button>
```

`v-if` acts an awful lot like JavaScript `if` - it will only display the HTML element it is on if the `v-if` statement returns `true`. In this case, it will check our `.data` for a value of `userIsLoggedIn`. Then it will only display our ‚ÄúLog Out‚Äù button if `userIsLoggedIn` is `true` and will only display our ‚ÄúLog In‚Äù button if it is `false`.

Another complex, common front-end need is to render an array of items identically. We can use v-for as an attribute, like so :

```html
<ul>
  <li v-for="todo in todoList">{{ todo }}</li>
</ul>
```

`v-for` will iterate through every item in our `.data`‚Äòs `todoList` array, create a variable called `todo` containing each succesive array element, and create an `li` displaying each element in the list. Even if a new item is added to the list, the list will be re-rendered instantly to display that new item.

One more super cool directive is `v-model`. `v-model` can be added to any form field and hooked up to our Vue app‚Äôs `data`. Modifying the form field will then automatically modify the specified Vue app `data`!

```html
<input v-model="username" />
```

The above input field will display the current value of `username` on the Vue app‚Äôs data object and will change the value of username if the user modifies the value in the field. That‚Äôs some complicated JavaScript implemented perfectly with very little code.

> üí° Note : As you may have noticed, every built-in Vue directive starts with `v-`. You can view a list of them all [here](https://vuejs.org/api/#Directives). Just know that if there isn‚Äôt a directive that does what you need ‚Äî you can even make your own!

Directives make complex front-end code easy to write, easy to read, and optimized for great site performance.

### Components 

When creating a component, you provide a template that should be rendered whenever the component is used in HTML. You then specify which pieces of dynamic information, called **props**, the component can receive to fill in this template. When used in your HTML code, props look like normal HTML attributes, you add them to the opening tag of the component HTML element with a name and a value.

```javascript
const Tweet = Vue.component('tweet', {
 props: ['message', 'author'],
 template: '<div class="tweet"><h3>{{ author }}</h3><p>{{ message }}</p></div>'
});
```

Once you‚Äôve created your component, you can then use it throughout your site just like any other HTML element. This means no copy/pasting of HTML code, no need to make the same change in multiple places across your site, and no potentially broken or misstyled elements.

```html
<div class="tweets">
  <tweet v-for="tweet in tweets" 
         v-bind:message="tweet"
         v-bind:author="username"></tweet>
</div>
```

## Quick review

* Make front-end code quicker to write ‚Äî loading Vue in one line, mustache templates, built-in **directives**, and re-usable **components** make Vue easy to read and easy to write.

* Make front-end code easier to modify and fix ‚Äî using readable mustache templates, using built-in heavily-tested **directives**, and consolidating repetitive code into **components** make Vue code less error-prone and easier to fix when errors do occur.

* Make front-end apps fast and responsive ‚Äî Vue‚Äôs use of a **Virtual DOM** makes site updates happen only when they need to and incredibly fast when they do

> üí° You might still be asking yourself at this point ‚Äî is Vue right for me? Should I be learning Angular or React instead? **The answer is that there is no right answer! All of these front-end frameworks work incredibly well and are getting better every year.** Each framework has its own syntax, but many of the skills you acquire will be transferable between frameworks. **React** also uses a **virtual DOM**. **Angular** also uses **directives**. Both use **mustache-like templates** and **components**. Learn the framework that is most exciting to you. All that matters is that you never get stuck in your learning journey.

## Naming
The Vue.js style guide recommends that component names should always be multi-word, except for root App components, to prevent conflicts with existing and future HTML elements. This is because the HTML Living Standard specifies that custom elements (which Vue components essentially are) must contain a hyphen in their name.

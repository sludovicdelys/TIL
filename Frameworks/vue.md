# Vue.js 

## Components 

### Naming
The Vue.js style guide recommends that component names should always be multi-word, except for root App components, to prevent conflicts with existing and future HTML elements. This is because the HTML Living Standard specifies that custom elements (which Vue components essentially are) must contain a hyphen in their name.

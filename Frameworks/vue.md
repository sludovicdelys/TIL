# Vue.js 

## Adding Vue
In summary, front-end frameworks aim to fix the following issues in front-end web development :
- Long development times
- Difficult bug fixes and updates
- Slow page rendering

The first thing you’ll need to do to begin using any front-end framework is to add the framework to your project. You can import Vue by adding a `<script>` tag inside the `<head>` of your project’s HTML file :

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js" defer></script>
```
We use the `defer` attribute on the `<script> tag to make sure that the page is loaded and ready to hook up to Vue before we actually load Vue.

The Vue team recognized that many complex front-end features aren’t useful until late in the front-end learning journey (or sometimes at all). As a result, they offered this simple alternative that provides most of Vue’s features to developers quickly and easily.

## Creating Vue Apps

Vue makes it easy to make a new app by exporting a class called `Vue`. Much like any other JavaScript class, we create instances of this class using the `new` keyword. Each of these `Vue` instances is a fully-functioning Vue app.

```javascript
// app.js
const app = new Vue({              //Creates new Vue app
  el: '#app',                      //Options Object
  data: { username: 'michael' },   //contains all information about the Vue app
  ...
});
```

The `Vue` constructor can set many properties on our `Vue` app when it is called. However, unlike many constructors, the `Vue` class does not take each of these properties as separate arguments.

> 💡 Vue apps require a lot of information — information that will differ greatly from app to app. To accommodate this, the Vue constructor doesn’t attempt to take in each piece of information as its own parameter. This would require developers to keep careful track of which order arguments were expected in, making it difficult to add properties or make changes.

The Vue constructor takes in only one object, called the **options object**. Each piece of information the Vue app needs to function is added to the options object as a key-value pair. This means that developers can easily update or add information in the Vue app by just looking for the correct key in the options object.

## Introduction to Vue

### el 
In making a new Vue app, we gain access to all of the powerful features Vue has to offer. However, we don’t necessarily want all of our HTML to have access to these features. We need to specify to our Vue app which portion of our HTML we want to gain access to our Vue app’s logic.

We do this by adding a key-value pair to the Vue app’s options object. We add a key called `el`, standing for HTML __el__ement, with a value of a CSS selector as a string that will target an element in our HTML and give it access to our Vue app’s functionality.

```javascript
// app.js
const app = new Vue({
  el: '#app'
});
```

In the above example, we wanted an HTML element with an ID of `app` to gain access to our Vue app’s functionality. We added an `el` key to the options object and made the value `'#app'`, a CSS selector that will target an element with an ID, `#`, of `app`.

We then import this JavaScript file into our HTML file so that our Vue app can find the specified HTML element and turn it into a Vue app.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<head>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue/dist/vue.js" defer></script>
  <script src="./js/app.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="app">
    <!-- Vue App HTML Code -->
  </div>
</body>
```

In this example, we wrote the HTML that will be turned into a Vue app. Then, in the `<head>` we imported the file containing the JavaScript from the previous example that will turn the HTML `#app` `<div>` element into a Vue app.

**Note**: We must import our Vue app code after the `<script>` that loads Vue.js. Otherwise, we would not yet have access to the Vue library in app.js, making it impossible to create a Vue app. This is also why we add `defer` to both elements — to ensure Vue has fully loaded when we go to make our Vue app.

## Components 

### Naming
The Vue.js style guide recommends that component names should always be multi-word, except for root App components, to prevent conflicts with existing and future HTML elements. This is because the HTML Living Standard specifies that custom elements (which Vue components essentially are) must contain a hyphen in their name.

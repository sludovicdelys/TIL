# Introduction to Drupal ðŸ’§
>[!IMPORTANT]
>This documentation was written while following the [Drupal 8 Beginner Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtaXuX0nEZk9MKY_ClWcPkGtOEGyLTyCO) presented by OSTraining on Youtube. I highly recommend to check out the tutorial âœ¨

CMS = Content Management System 
Before each page was its own file, but this is not efficient for large systems. 
What does a CMS do : 
- Action : Click on link
- **DRUPAL** CMS ->  that the user wants the content from this particular area of the website. 
- That content is stored in a **DATABASE**
- **DRUPAL** -> the user wants a particular design, a **THEME**
Changes are applied to every single page of the website 

Itâ€™s open source, so itâ€™s free. Itâ€™s licensed to use, change and redistribute. Drupalâ€™s community is mostly based on volunteers. Drupal was founded in 2000 by Dries Buytaert, in his dorm room. It was first a chat platform. 

**Who uses Drupal**
Drupal is the platform for many government agencies in the United States, London, France and more use to communicate with citizens. Itâ€™s the framework media companies like BBC, NBC, MTV UK, rely on to inform and entertain the world. 
Itâ€™s part of how organisations and universities like Amnesty International and the University of Oxford work to make the world a better place.

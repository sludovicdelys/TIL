# Java vs JavaScript

## Java
- Statistically typed language
- Declaring variables is much more rigid 
  - You have to mention the type of value that will be stored in a  specific variable.
    - `String name = “Hasselhoff”;`
    - `int benchPress = 114;`
    - `String[ ] myStringArray = {“a”, ”b”, “c”,}`
  - The type of data will remain for the entire lifetime of that variable
    - `newJerseyLegend=3;`
- Class based object oriented programming language
  - Example : Let’s print “Here’s a bag of Cheese curls”
  - The use of classes is mandatory
    - Classes serve as reusable templates to produce objects
    - Objects are types of data structures that store information
    - ```
      public class CheeseCurls {
      	public static void main(String[] args) {
      		System.out.println("Here's a bag of Cheese curls");
      	}
      }
      ```
- Slow start but it has a very stable future

### What can you build ? 
- Not commonly used with web de development
- Used more away from the web e.g. with hardware, Android app development
- Large scale projects (e.g. banks, trading, automotive)
- Android mobile apps
- Big data, heavy CPU usage
- Back-end
- Hardware and Internet of Things (IoT)

## JavaScript
- Dynamically typed language
  - `let lastName = “Coppola”;`
  - `lastName = 4;`
  - `lastName = “Cage”;`
- Prototype based object oriented programming language
  - Not bound to a code pattern like in Java 
  - Example : Let’s print “Here’s a bag of Cheese curls”
    - `console.log(“Here’s a bag of Cheese curls”);`
  - Recently **JavaScript update** to include this kind of similar class construction that we see in other **class based object oriented languages**
- Easy to get off the ground, but once you have a massive application it is hard to upkeep.

### What can you build ? 
- Was built for the web, alongside HTML and CSS
- Now dominates web development, often referred to as the language of the web
- Made for front-end of single page web applications (no-reload)
- Now it’s evolved! It can do more with libraries, frameworks, open source, etc.
  - Node.js lets you do back-end JS
  - Even used to make Android or iOS mobile apps

## What about hiring ? 
**Java is preferred in the computer science and enterprise business community** but JavaScript is the new and fresh thing.

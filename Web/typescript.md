## Class Types 

* `public`: Primarily useful for readability reasons, since all properties and methods are public in JavaScript.
* `private`: Prevents all derived classes and instances from accessing properties and methods.
* `protected`: Only allows derived classes to access properties and methods, and prevents all class instances from accessing.
* `readonly`: Prevents reassigning a property or method, except in the classâ€™ `.constructor()` method.

With these keywords, we can add clarity to our code and control when properties and methods are accessed in our programs. 
That control allows us to follow object-oriented patterns, which can help us reduce the chance of bugs, in addition to helping us keep our code organized and consistent.

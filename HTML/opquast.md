I have started practicing my algorithm solving skills, and I am currently working on arrays which have been proven to be quite mentally taxing although I am only on the easy section of the website. I have been looking at the solutions every time, and asking ChatGPT (This is not a very eco friendly learning practice 😣) to explain bits of code I do not understand. 

I'll be keeping a record of the algorithms I come accross for future reference and to be able to reflect on them.
